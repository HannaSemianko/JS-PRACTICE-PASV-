Your task is to find all the elements of an array that are non consecutive.

A number is non consecutive if it is not exactly one larger than the previous element in the array.
The first element gets a pass and is never considered non consecutive.

Create a function named allNonConsecutive

E.g., if we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8,15,16] then 6 and 15 are non-consecutive.

You should return the results as an array of objects with two values i: <the index of the non-consecutive number> and n: <the non-consecutive number>.

E.g., for the above array the result should be:

[
  {i: 4, n:6},
  {i: 7, n:16}
]

function allNonConsecutive (arr) {
 let i;
 let n;
  let num = [];
  for (let j = 0; j < arr.length-1; j++){
    if ( arr[j+1] - arr[j] !== 1){
      n = arr[j+1];
      i= j+1;
      num.push({i : i, n : n});
    }      
  }
  return num;
}
