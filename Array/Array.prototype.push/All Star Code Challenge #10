This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students

Create a function named fibonacci() that takes a number argument, N, and gets the Nth number in a fibonacci sequence.

The fibonacci sequence is created by adding the previous 2 numbers together to form the next number in the sequence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...

Note:
Assume the first 2 numbers in the fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1
An input of 0 should return 0

fibonacci(5); // => 5
fibonacci(6); // => 8
fibonacci(0); // => 0

function  fibonacci(n){
  let arr =[0, 1];
  for (let i = 2; i <=n; i++) {
    arr[i] = arr[i -2] + arr[i -1];
    arr.push[arr[i]];
  }
 return arr[n];
}
