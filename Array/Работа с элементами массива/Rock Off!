Alice's band plays a Nirvana inspired grunge and has been rated 20 for Heaviness, 32 for Originality and only 18 for Outfits. Bob listens to Slayer and has gotten a good 48 for Heaviness, 25 for Originality and a rather honest 40 for Outfits.

The total score should be followed by a colon : and by one of the following quotes: if Alice's band wins: Alice made "Kurt" proud! if Bob's band wins: Bob made "Jeff" proud! if they end up with a draw: that looks like a "draw"! Rock on!

The solution to the example above should therefore appear like '1, 2: Bob made "Jeff" proud!'.


function solve(a, b) {
  let countA = 0;
  let countB = 0;
    if (a[0]>b[0]) countA++;
    if (a[0]<b[0]) countB++;
    if (a[1]>b[1]) countA++;
    if (a[1]<b[1]) countB++;
    if (a[2]>b[2]) countA++;
    if (a[2]<b[2]) countB++;
      if (countA > countB) return `${countA}, ${countB}: Alice made "Kurt" proud!`;
      if (countA < countB ) return `${countA}, ${countB}: Bob made "Jeff" proud!`;
      else return `${countA}, ${countB}: that looks like a "draw"! Rock on!`;
}
