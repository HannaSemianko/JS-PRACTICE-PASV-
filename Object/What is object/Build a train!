Your job is to return the amount of metal needed to build the train. You are given a string. The string will look something like this:

str = 'A________'
Where the 'A' is a type of a locomotive and "_ " is a coach after the train.

RULES:

A = 15 pieces of metal

B = 10 pieces of metal

C = 7 pieces of metal

D = 8 pieces of metal

The coaches take 5 pieces of metal to make(for each).

###EXAMPLE###

train('A_') = 20, 15 for A type, and 5 for coach
The value is supposed to be an integer

Another example:

train('B__') = 20, 10 for B type, and 10 for coaches(2 coaches, 5 pieces of metal each)
All translations and edits welcome!

function train(s) {
let obj = {"A": 15, "B": 10, "C": 7, "D": 8};
return  obj[s[0]] + (s.length - 1) * 5;
}
