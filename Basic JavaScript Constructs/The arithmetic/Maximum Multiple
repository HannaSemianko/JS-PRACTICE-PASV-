Given a Divisor and a Bound , Find the largest integer N , Such That ,

Conditions :
N is divisible by divisor

N is less than or equal to bound

N is greater than 0.

It's guaranteed that a divisor is Found .
Input >> Output Examples
maxMultiple (2,7) ==> return (6)

function maxMultiple(divisor, bound){
  for(let i = bound; i > 0; i--){
    if (i % divisor === 0){ return i; brake}
  }
}
